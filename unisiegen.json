    "instruction": "Mask obligation",
    "input": "Wearing a mask is obligatory for all participants of an examination (incl. the invigilator) during the entire examination time. Access to the examination room is not permitted without a mask. Before or during the examination, the mask may be pulled down briefly for identification purposes or to eat or drink something. Students who do not wear a mask beyond these exceptions may be excluded from the examination. In this case, the exam will be counted as 'failed to appear' (and thus failed). We recommend wearing FFP2 masks, which provide better protection than surgical masks. There is an exception to the mask requirement only for medical reasons; in this case, the examinees must be able to show the relevant medical certificate.",

Mask can be briefly pulled down for identification or consuming food/drink. Failure to comply with mask requirement may result in exclusion from the exam, considered as 'failed to appear.'

    "instruction": "Home isolation (quarantine)",
    "input": "Due to the expected course of the pandemic, it is likely that there will be students who are in domestic isolation (quarantine) on the date of an attendance examination. A quarantine, if necessary, will be evaluated like a medical certificate, i.e. the affected students will be subsequently deregistered from the examination by the examination office. The prerequisite is that the necessity of the quarantine is proven by a written confirmation. Exactly which written confirmation must be provided can be found in the following sections. It must be sent to the examination office within 4 weeks of the examination day (by e-mail, e.g. as a scan of the documents required for the proof). In addition, the examination office must be informed by email of non-participation in the examination no later than on the day of the examination.",
    "output": "If students are in home isolation (quarantine) on the exam date, it will be treated as a medical certificate. They will be deregistered from the exam upon providing written confirmation of the quarantine's necessity. The confirmation must be sent to the examination office within 4 weeks of the exam day. Additionally, non-participation must be informed to the examination office via email on the day of the exam."

As proof, the examination office requires the test result for the infected person, plus proof of the shared address, e.g. copies of the registration certificates (at the residents' registration office).",

    "input": "Even if one does not have to go into quarantine oneself, corona-related emergencies can occur, e.g. if one's own child is not allowed to go to daycare after a positive pool test (lollipop test) and no care can be organized at short notice. In such cases, non-attendance at an examination will not be counted upon informal application to the relevant subject examination board. The request must be made within 4 weeks and must be accompanied by suitable written proof of the emergency.",

This serves to protect against infection, but also means that the temperature in these rooms tends to be low. Please be prepared for this and dress warmly.",
